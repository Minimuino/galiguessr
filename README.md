# GaliGuessr

React geography quiz üåç Originally designed for [Galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)) but customizable for any region in the world. Try it for yourself at https://minimuino.github.io/galiguessr/

## Features

- Four game modes: Point & Click, Write Name, Guess Location and Guess the City.
- Load any valid geojson file and create a custom map quiz.
- Responsive design.

## Usage

Go to [the custom quiz page](https://minimuino.github.io/galiguessr/custom-quiz), choose a valid geojson file from your local storage, select game mode and hit play button. The geojson file must meet two requirements:
- It is a valid geojson: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946
- Every Feature item has a `properties` field that includes the `name` property with some string value.

There are several websites you can use to get nice geospatial data:
- https://overpass-turbo.eu/
- https://www.naturalearthdata.com/
- https://github.com/martynafford/natural-earth-geojson
- https://gadm.org/

You can also make your own geography quiz by following these steps:
1. Fork or copy this repo.
2. Choose a name and logo for your project and set it in metadata properties.
3. Replace all files in `/data/geojson` with your own. Make sure each Feature item has an `id` field and a `properties` field that includes the `name` property.
4. Edit `/src/assets/settings.json` to reference each one of your geojson files.
5. Set your language to 'en' in `/src/i18n.ts`, or add new i18n files if you want to.
6. Edit `/src/components/CreditsModal.tsx` to add your own copyright notice.
7. Deploy and enjoy!
